<p>My name is Jonathan Cardiel and I'm from Idaho Falls. I'm currently studying software engineering and I'm really passionate about programming and building software solutions.</p>
<p>When I'm not working on my projects or studying, I like to unwind by playing video games. It's been a hobby of mine for years and I enjoy the challenge and immersion that comes with it.</p>
